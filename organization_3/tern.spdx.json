Karr\n Copyright (C)  1992 Ronald S. Karr\n Copyleft (GNU) 1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr\n\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also\n use this wording to make the terms for other programs.\n\n  The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the\nmercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is\nintended to give everyone the right to share SMAIL.  To make sure that\nyou get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions\nthat forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\nthe rights.  Hence this license agreement.\n\n  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give\naway copies of SMAIL, that you receive source code or else can get it\nif you want it, that you can change SMAIL or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to\ndeprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute\ncopies of SMAIL, you must give the recipients all the rights that you\nhave.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n\n  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone\nfinds out that there is no warranty for SMAIL.  If SMAIL is modified by\nsomeone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what\nthey have is not what we distributed, so that any problems introduced\nby others will not reflect on our reputation.\n\n  Therefore we (Landon Curt Noll and Ronald S. Karr) make the following \nterms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change \nSMAIL.\n\n\n\t\t\tCOPYING POLICIES\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of SMAIL source code\nas you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice \"Copyright\n(C) 1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr\" (or with whatever year is\nappropriate); keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this\nLicense Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\nother recipients of the SMAIL program a copy of this License\nAgreement along with the program.  You may charge a distribution fee\nfor the physical act of transferring a copy.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of SMAIL or any portion of it,\nand copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of\nParagraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,\n    that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of SMAIL or\n    any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third\n    parties on terms identical to those contained in this License\n    Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive\n    warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\n    c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of\n    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty\n    protection in exchange for a fee.\n\nMere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or its\nderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\nthe other program under the scope of these terms.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute SMAIL (or a portion or derivative of it,\nunder Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nParagraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal\n    shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for non-commercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\nFor an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for\nall modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include\nsource code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the\noperating system on which the executable file runs.\n\n  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL\nexcept as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL is void and\nyour rights to use the program under this License agreement shall be\nautomatically terminated.  However, parties who have received computer\nsoftware programs from you with this License Agreement will not have\ntheir licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. If you wish to incorporate parts of SMAIL into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to Landon\nCurt Noll & Ronald S. Karr via the Free Software Foundation at 51\nFranklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.  We have not yet\nworked out a simple rule that can be stated here, but we will often\npermit this.  We will be guided by the two goals of preserving the\nfree status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting\nthe sharing and reuse of software.\n\nYour comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our\nsoftware are welcome!

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which\ncan also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names\nbeginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

See below for details. The documentation is licensed under\nthe GPLv2 (or later), see below.\n\nExcerpt from upstream's README:\n\n    The library is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser\n    General Public License (LGPL); see the file COPYING.LIB for the\n    actual terms.  The helper programs (e.g. gcryptrnd and getrandom)\n    as well as the documentation are distributed under the terms of\n    the GNU General Public License (GPL); see the file COPYING for the\n    actual terms.\n\n    This library used to be available under the GPL - this was changed\n    with version 1.1.7 with the rationale that there are now many free\n    crypto libraries available and many of them come with capabilities\n    similar to Libcrypt.  We decided that to foster the use of\n    cryptography in Free Software an LGPLed library would make more\n    sense because it avoids problems due to license incompatibilities\n    between some Free Software licenses and the GPL.\n\n    Please note that in many cases it is better for a library to be\n    licensed under the GPL, so that it provides an advantage for free\n    software projects.  The Lesser GPL is so named because it does\n    less to protect the freedom of the users of the code that it\n    covers.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\n\n  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n      the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n      moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n      publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n      rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n      rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n      database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n      other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n      No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n      Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n      Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n      Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.\n\n============================================\n\ndoc/examples/tlsproxy/\nCopyright: Copyright (c) 2016 Wrymouth Innovation Ltd\nLicense: The MIT License (MIT)\n Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\n copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\n to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation\n the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,\n and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\n Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\n in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Major\n portions are based on code by other authors; see AUTHORS for details.\n Most of the source has been put into the public domain, but some files\n have not (details below).\n .\n This file describes the source package.  The binary packages contain\n some files derived from other works: for example, images in the API\n documentation come from Doxygen.\nLicense:\n Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here\n is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this\n package (but check the individual files to be sure!):\n .\n   - liblzma is in the public domain.\n .\n   - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public\n     domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked\n     in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under\n     GNU LGPLv2.1+.\n .\n   - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been\n     adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are\n     under GNU GPLv2+.\n .\n   - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the\n     XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories\n     are in the public domain.\n .\n   - Translated messages are in the public domain.\n .\n   - The build system contains public domain files, and files that\n     are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up\n     in the binaries being built.\n .\n   - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging\n     utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.\n .\n   - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files\n     that are under various free software licenses.\n .\n You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into\n the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,\n take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find\n the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many\n lawyers.\n .\n As usual, this software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty.\n .\n If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils\n into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is\n polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but\n naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good\n notice to put into \"about box\" or into documentation:\n .\n     This software includes code from XZ Utils <http://tukaani.org/xz/>.\n .\n The following license texts are included in the following files:\n   - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1\n   - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2\n   - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3\n .\n Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code\n pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma\n binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety\n even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source\n package.\n .\n If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more\n information.\n\nFiles: *\nCopyright: 2006-2018, Lasse Collin\n           1999-2008, Igor Pavlov\n           2006, Ville Koskinen\n           1998, Steve Reid\n           2000, Wei Dai\n           2003, Kevin Springle\n           2009, Jonathan Nieder\n           2010, Anders F Bj\u00f6rklund\nLicense: PD\n This file has been put in the public domain.\n You can do whatever you want with this file.\nComment:\n  From: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>\n  To: Jonathan Nieder <jrnieder@gmail.com>\n  Subject: Re: XZ utils for Debian\n  Date: Sun, 19 Jul 2009 13:28:23 +0300\n  Message-Id: <200907191328.23816.lasse.collin@tukaani.org>\n .\n [...]\n .\n  > AUTHORS, ChangeLog, COPYING, README, THANKS, TODO,\n  > dos/README, windows/README\n .\n  COPYING says that most docs are in the public domain. Maybe that's not\n  clear enough, but on the other hand it looks a bit stupid to put\n  copyright information in tiny and relatively small docs like README.\n .\n  I don't dare to say that _all_ XZ Utils specific docs are in the public\n  domain unless otherwise mentioned in the file. I'm including PDF files\n  generated by groff + ps2pdf, and some day I might include Doxygen-\n  generated HTML docs too. Those don't include any copyright notices, but\n  it seems likely that groff + ps2pdf or at least Doxygen put some\n  copyrighted content into the generated files.\n\nFiles: INSTALL NEWS PACKAGERS\n windows/README-Windows.txt\n windows/INSTALL-MinGW.txt\nCopyright: 2009-2010, Lasse Collin\nLicense: probably-PD\n See the note on AUTHORS, README, and so on above.\n\nFiles: src/scripts/* lib/* extra/scanlzma/scanlzma.c\nCopyright: \u00a9 1993, Jean-loup Gailly\n           \u00a9 1989-1994, 1996-1999, 2001-2007, Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n           \u00a9 2006 Timo Lindfors\n           2005, Charles Levert\n           2005, 2009, Lasse Collin\n           2009, Andrew Dudman\nOther-Authors: Paul Eggert, Ulrich Drepper\nLicense: GPL-2+\n\nFiles: src/scripts/Makefile.am src/scripts/xzless.1\nCopyright: 2009, Andrew Dudman\n           2009, Lasse Collin\nLicense: PD\n This file has been put in the public domain.\n You can do whatever you want with this file.\n\nFiles: doc/examples/xz_pipe_comp.c doc/examples/xz_pipe_decomp.c\nCopyright: 2010, Daniel Mealha Cabrita\nLicense: PD\n Not copyrighted -- provided to the public domain.\n\nFiles: lib/getopt.c lib/getopt1.c lib/getopt.in.h\nCopyright: \u00a9 1987-2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nOther-Authors: Ulrich Drepper\nLicense: LGPL-2.1+\n\nFiles: m4/getopt.m4 m4/posix-shell.m4\nCopyright: \u00a9 2002-2006, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n           \u00a9 2007-2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nOther-Authors: Bruno Haible, Paul Eggert\nLicense: permissive-fsf\n\nFiles: m4/acx_pthread.m4\nCopyright: \u00a9 2008, Steven G.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

If the\n terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to\n make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek\n a different licensing arrangement.\n .\n Definitions\n .\n \"Copyright Holder\" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in\n the copyright notice for the entire Package.\n .\n \"Contributor\" means any party that has contributed code or other\n material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's\n procedures.\n .\n \"You\" and \"your\" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,\n or modify the Package.\n .\n \"Package\" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright\n Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A\n given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a\n Modified Version.\n .\n \"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it\n accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\n organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n .\n \"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this\n Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It\n does not mean licensing fees.\n .\n \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,\n or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the\n Copyright Holder.\n .\n \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such\n changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\n .\n \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the\n Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may\n be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n .\n \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and\n configuration files for the Package.\n .\n \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or\n any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation\n of the Source form.\n .\n Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n .\n (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\n Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\n you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\n .\n Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n .\n (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\n Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\n either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\n all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At\n your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\n Compiled form of the Package.\n .\n (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\n modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting\n Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\n will be subject to the Original License.\n .\n Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n .\n (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\n or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\n Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\n from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\n any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\n you do at least ONE of the following:\n .\n (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the\n Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright\n Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. (b)\n ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the\n user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the\n Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of\n the Standard Version. (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the\n Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version\n available to others under (i) the Original License or (ii) a license\n that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the\n Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy\n that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the\n Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\n available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are\n allowed.\n .\n Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified\n Versions without the Source\n .\n (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\n the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\n get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be\n valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any\n time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\n must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\n If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\n days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\n you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n .\n (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the\n Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the\n Source of the Modified Version.\n .\n Aggregating or Linking the Package\n .\n (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\n Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\n aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\n Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\n components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\n apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\n as included in the aggregation.\n .\n (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\n other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\n build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\n include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\n provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n .\n Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n .\n (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\n merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\n the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not\n considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\n terms of this license.\n .\n General Provisions\n .\n (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\n Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\n modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\n use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\n license.\n .\n (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version\n made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to\n ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\n this license.\n .\n (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\n service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n .\n (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\n free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\n sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\n patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\n infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\n that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\n infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\n date that such litigation is filed.\n .\n (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT\n HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED\n WARRANTIES.

Copyright and Related Rights include, but are\n not limited to, the following:\n .\n    the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\n    communicate, and translate a Work;\n .\n    moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n .\n    publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n    likeness depicted in a Work;\n .\n    rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n    subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n .\n    rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n .\n    database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC\n    of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996\n    on the legal protection of databases, and under any national\n    implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version\n    of such directive); and\n .\n    other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n    thereof.\n .\n 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\n of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\n irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all\n of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and\n causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing\n as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in\n all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by\n applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\n in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)\n for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,\n advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the\n Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\n detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such\n Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the\n quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's\n express Statement of Purpose.\n .\n 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any\n reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,\n then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted\n taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In\n addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby\n grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non\n sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license\n to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i)\n in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided\n by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\n in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)\n for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,\n advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall\n be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity\n or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,\n and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)\n exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in\n the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action\n with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express\n Statement of Purpose.\n .\n 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n .\n    No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,\n    abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this\n    document.\n .\n    Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\n    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties\n    of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non\n    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,\n    or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,\n    all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n .\n    Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other\n    persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including\n    without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the\n    Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any\n    necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any\n    use of the Work.\n .\n    Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not\n    a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect\n    to this CC0 or use of the Work.\nComment:\n This license text was retrieved from\n <http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>\n on Fri, 05 Feb 2016 20:30:28 +0200\n\nLicense: RRA-KEEP-THIS-NOTICE\n Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification, are\n permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright notice and\n this notice are preserved.

(You will not be required to justify it to the\n         Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large\n         as a market that must bear the fee.)\n .\n         \"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item\n         itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.\n         It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it\n         under the same conditions they received it.\n .\n 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the\n Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you\n duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n .\n 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications\n derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package\n modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n .\n 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided\n that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and\n when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the\n following:\n .\n     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them\n     Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or\n     an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive\n     site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include\n     your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\n .\n     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n .\n     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict\n     with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide\n     a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly\n     documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n .\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n .\n 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or\n executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n .\n     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,\n     together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where\n     to get the Standard Version.\n .\n     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of\n     the Package with your modifications.\n .\n     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly\n     document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together\n     with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n .\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n .\n 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this\n Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this\n Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,\n you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly\n commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software\n distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a\n product of your own.\n .\n 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as\n output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall\n under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated\n them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this\n Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this\n Package via the so-called \"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods of producing a\n binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall\n neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it\n fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do\n not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this\n Package.\n .\n 7. You may reuse parts of this Package in your own programs, provided that\n you explicitly state where you got them from, in the source code (and, left\n to your courtesy, in the documentation), duplicating all the associated\n copyright notices and disclaimers. Besides your changes, if any, must be\n clearly marked as such. Parts reused that way will no longer fall under this\n license if, and only if, the name of your program(s) have no immediate\n connection with the name of the Package itself or its associated programs.\n You may then apply whatever restrictions you wish on the reused parts or\n choose to place them in the Public Domain--this will apply only within the\n context of your package.\n .\n 8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote\n products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n .\n 9.

License Grants and Conditions\n --------------------------------\n .\n 2.1. Grants\n .\n Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\n non-exclusive license:\n .\n (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)\n     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,\n     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its\n     Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or\n     as part of a Larger Work; and\n .\n (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer\n     for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its\n     Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n .\n 2.2. Effective Date\n .\n The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\n become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\n distributes such Contribution.\n .\n 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n .\n The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\n this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\n distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\n Contributor:\n .\n (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n     or\n .\n (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n     Version); or\n .\n (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n     its Contributions.\n .\n This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\n the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n .\n 2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n .\n No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\n License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\n permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n .\n 2.5. Representation\n .\n Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\n to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n .\n 2.6. Fair Use\n .\n This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\n applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\n equivalents.\n .\n 2.7. Conditions\n .\n Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\n in Section 2.1.\n .\n 3. Responsibilities\n -------------------\n .\n 3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n .\n All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n Form.\n .\n 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n .\n If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n .\n (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n .\n (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n .\n 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n .\n You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n License(s).\n .\n 3.4. Notices\n .\n You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n .\n 3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n .\n You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n jurisdiction.\n .\n 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n ---------------------------------------------------\n .\n If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n .\n 5. Termination\n --------------\n .\n 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n Your receipt of the notice.\n .\n 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n .\n 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n prior to termination shall survive termination.\n .\n ************************************************************************\n *                                                                      *\n *  6.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of\n'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which\ncan also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names\nbeginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit\nversions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all\nlibraries support biarch.)

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of\n'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which\ncan also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names\nbeginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit\nversions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all\nlibraries support biarch.)

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You are\nwelcomed to your opinions. I suggest, however, that before you rely\non your or other people's opinions (including ours), that you consult\nwith a lawyer familiar with applicable law and the particulars of your\nsituation.\n\nThe Foundation sees no reason for it to expend its limited resources\nseeking clarifications which it believes are unnecessary.  You are,\nof course, welcomed to expend time and energy seeking clarifications\nyou think are necessary.  I suggest you contact University's general\ncounsel office (http://www.umich.edu/~vpgc/).\n\nRegards, Kurt\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n", "comment": "libldap-2.4-2:\n\twarning: No metadata for key: pkg_license\n\twarning: No metadata for key: download_url\n\twarning: No metadata for key: checksum\n\twarning: No metadata for key: pkg_format\n"}, {"name": "libldap-common", "SPDXID": "SPDXRef-libldap-common-2.4.47-dfsg-3-deb10u6", "versionInfo": "2.4.47+dfsg-3+deb10u6", "downloadLocation": "NONE", "filesAnalyzed": "false", "licenseConcluded": "NOASSERTION", "licenseDeclared": "NONE", "copyrightText": "\nThis package was downloaded from:\n\n    <http://www.openldap.org/>\n\nThe upstream distribution has been repackaged to remove the RFCs and\nInternet-Drafts included in the upstream distribution, since the Internet\nSociety license does not meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines.

You are\nwelcomed to your opinions. I suggest, however, that before you rely\non your or other people's opinions (including ours), that you consult\nwith a lawyer familiar with applicable law and the particulars of your\nsituation.\n\nThe Foundation sees no reason for it to expend its limited resources\nseeking clarifications which it believes are unnecessary.  You are,\nof course, welcomed to expend time and energy seeking clarifications\nyou think are necessary.  I suggest you contact University's general\ncounsel office (http://www.umich.edu/~vpgc/).\n\nRegards, Kurt\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n", "comment": "libldap-common:\n\twarning: No metadata for key: pkg_license\n\twarning: No metadata for key: download_url\n\twarning: No metadata for key: checksum\n\twarning: No metadata for key: pkg_format\n"}, {"name": "liblocale-gettext-perl", "SPDXID": "SPDXRef-liblocale-gettext-perl-1.07-3-b4", "versionInfo": "1.07-3+b4", "downloadLocation": "NONE", "filesAnalyzed": "false", "licenseConcluded": "NOASSERTION", "licenseDeclared": "NONE", "copyrightText": "\nFormat: https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/\nUpstream-Name: Locale-gettext\nUpstream-Contact: Phillip Vandry <vandry@TZoNE.ORG>\nSource: https://metacpan.org/release/gettext\n\nFiles: *\nCopyright: 1996-2005, Phillip Vandry <vandry@TZoNE.ORG>\nLicense: Artistic or GPL-1+\n\nFiles: debian/*\nCopyright: 1998-2009, Rapha\u00ebl Hertzog <hertzog@debian.org>\n 2008, Niko Tyni <ntyni@debian.org>\n 2010-2011, gregor herrmann <gregoa@debian.org>\nLicense: Artistic or GPL-1+\n\nLicense: Artistic\n This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n it under the terms of the Artistic License, which comes with Perl.\n .\n On Debian systems, the complete text of the Artistic License can be\n found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/Artistic'.\n\nLicense: GPL-1+\n This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)\n any later version.\n .\n On Debian systems, the complete text of version 1 of the GNU General\n Public License can be found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-1'.\n", "comment": "liblocale-gettext-perl:\n\twarning: No metadata for key: pkg_license\n\twarning: No metadata for key: download_url\n\twarning: No metadata for key: checksum\n\twarning: No metadata for key: pkg_format\n"}, {"name": "liblsan0", "SPDXID": "SPDXRef-liblsan0-8.3.0-6", "versionInfo": "8.3.0-6", "downloadLocation": "NONE", "filesAnalyzed": "false", "licenseConcluded": "NOASSERTION", "licenseDeclared": "NONE", "copyrightText": "\nThis is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler\ncollection, containing Ada, C, C++, Fortran 95, Objective-C,\nObjective-C++, and Treelang compilers, documentation, and support\nlibraries.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Grants\n .\n Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\n non-exclusive license:\n .\n (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)\n     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,\n     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its\n     Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or\n     as part of a Larger Work; and\n .\n (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer\n     for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its\n     Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n .\n 2.2. Effective Date\n .\n The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\n become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\n distributes such Contribution.\n .\n 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n .\n The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\n this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\n distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\n Contributor:\n .\n (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n     or\n .\n (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n     Version); or\n .\n (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n     its Contributions.\n .\n This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\n the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n .\n 2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n .\n No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\n License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\n permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n .\n 2.5. Representation\n .\n Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\n to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n .\n 2.6. Fair Use\n .\n This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\n applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\n equivalents.\n .\n 2.7. Conditions\n .\n Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\n in Section 2.1.\n .\n 3. Responsibilities\n -------------------\n .\n 3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n .\n All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n Form.\n .\n 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n .\n If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n .\n (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n .\n (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n .\n 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n .\n You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n License(s).\n .\n 3.4. Notices\n .\n You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n .\n 3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n .\n You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n jurisdiction.\n .\n 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n ---------------------------------------------------\n .\n If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n .\n 5. Termination\n --------------\n .\n 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n Your receipt of the notice.\n .\n 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n .\n 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n prior to termination shall survive termination.\n .\n ************************************************************************\n *                                                                      *\n *  6.

Litigation\n -------------\n .\n Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\n courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\n place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\n jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\n Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\n cross-claims or counter-claims.\n .\n 9. Miscellaneous\n ----------------\n .\n This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\n matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\n that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\n shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n .\n 10. Versions of the License\n ---------------------------\n .\n 10.1. New Versions\n .\n Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n distinguishing version number.\n .\n 10.2. Effect of New Versions\n .\n You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\n of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\n or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n steward.\n .\n 10.3. Modified Versions\n .\n If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n such modified license differs from this License).\n .\n 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\n Licenses\n .\n If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\n Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\n notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n .\n Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n -------------------------------------------\n .\n   This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\n   License, v. 2.0.

Effective Date\n .\n The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\n become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\n distributes such Contribution.\n .\n 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n .\n The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\n this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\n distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\n Contributor:\n .\n (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n     or\n .\n (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n     Version); or\n .\n (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n     its Contributions.\n .\n This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\n the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n .\n 2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n .\n No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\n License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\n permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n .\n 2.5. Representation\n .\n Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\n to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n .\n 2.6. Fair Use\n .\n This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\n applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\n equivalents.\n .\n 2.7. Conditions\n .\n Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\n in Section 2.1.\n .\n 3. Responsibilities\n -------------------\n .\n 3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n .\n All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n Form.\n .\n 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n .\n If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n .\n (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n .\n (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n .\n 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n .\n You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n License(s).\n .\n 3.4. Notices\n .\n You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n .\n 3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n .\n You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n jurisdiction.\n .\n 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n ---------------------------------------------------\n .\n If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n .\n 5. Termination\n --------------\n .\n 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n Your receipt of the notice.\n .\n 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n .\n 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n prior to termination shall survive termination.\n .\n ************************************************************************\n *                                                                      *\n *  6.

Litigation\n -------------\n .\n Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\n courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\n place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\n jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\n Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\n cross-claims or counter-claims.\n .\n 9. Miscellaneous\n ----------------\n .\n This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\n matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\n that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\n shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n .\n 10. Versions of the License\n ---------------------------\n .\n 10.1. New Versions\n .\n Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n distinguishing version number.\n .\n 10.2. Effect of New Versions\n .\n You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\n of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\n or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n steward.\n .\n 10.3. Modified Versions\n .\n If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n such modified license differs from this License).\n .\n 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\n Licenses\n .\n If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\n Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\n notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n .\n Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n -------------------------------------------\n .\n   This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\n   License, v. 2.0.

If the\n terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to\n make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek\n a different licensing arrangement.\n .\n Definitions\n .\n \"Copyright Holder\" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in\n the copyright notice for the entire Package.\n .\n \"Contributor\" means any party that has contributed code or other\n material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's\n procedures.\n .\n \"You\" and \"your\" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,\n or modify the Package.\n .\n \"Package\" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright\n Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A\n given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a\n Modified Version.\n .\n \"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it\n accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\n organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n .\n \"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this\n Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It\n does not mean licensing fees.\n .\n \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,\n or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the\n Copyright Holder.\n .\n \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such\n changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\n .\n \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the\n Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may\n be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n .\n \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and\n configuration files for the Package.\n .\n \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or\n any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation\n of the Source form.\n .\n Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n .\n (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\n Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\n you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\n .\n Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n .\n (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\n Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\n either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\n all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At\n your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\n Compiled form of the Package.\n .\n (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\n modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting\n Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\n will be subject to the Original License.\n .\n Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n .\n (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\n or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\n Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\n from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\n any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\n you do at least ONE of the following:\n .\n (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the\n Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright\n Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. (b)\n ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the\n user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the\n Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of\n the Standard Version. (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the\n Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version\n available to others under (i) the Original License or (ii) a license\n that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the\n Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy\n that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the\n Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\n available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are\n allowed.\n .\n Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified\n Versions without the Source\n .\n (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\n the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\n get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be\n valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any\n time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\n must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\n If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\n days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\n you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n .\n (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the\n Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the\n Source of the Modified Version.\n .\n Aggregating or Linking the Package\n .\n (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\n Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\n aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\n Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\n components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\n apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\n as included in the aggregation.\n .\n (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\n other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\n build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\n include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\n provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n .\n Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n .\n (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\n merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\n the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not\n considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\n terms of this license.\n .\n General Provisions\n .\n (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\n Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\n modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\n use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\n license.\n .\n (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version\n made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to\n ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\n this license.\n .\n (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\n service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n .\n (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\n free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\n sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\n patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\n infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\n that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\n infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\n date that such litigation is filed.\n .\n (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT\n HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED\n WARRANTIES.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal\n of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and\n scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for\n their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\n .\n For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\n expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person\n associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that\n he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,\n voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute\n the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and\n Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect\n of CC0 on those rights.\n .\n 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright\n and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are\n not limited to, the following:\n .\n    the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\n    communicate, and translate a Work;\n .\n    moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n .\n    publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n    likeness depicted in a Work;\n .\n    rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n    subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n .\n    rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n .\n    database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC\n    of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996\n    on the legal protection of databases, and under any national\n    implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version\n    of such directive); and\n .\n    other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n    thereof.\n .\n 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\n of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\n irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all\n of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and\n causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing\n as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in\n all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by\n applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\n in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)\n for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,\n advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the\n Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\n detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such\n Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the\n quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's\n express Statement of Purpose.\n .\n 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any\n reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,\n then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted\n taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In\n addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby\n grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non\n sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license\n to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i)\n in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided\n by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\n in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)\n for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,\n advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall\n be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity\n or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,\n and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)\n exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in\n the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action\n with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express\n Statement of Purpose.\n .\n 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n .\n    No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,\n    abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this\n    document.\n .\n    Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\n    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties\n    of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non\n    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,\n    or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,\n    all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n .\n    Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other\n    persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including\n    without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the\n    Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any\n    necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any\n    use of the Work.\n .\n    Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not\n    a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect\n    to this CC0 or use of the Work.\nComment:\n This license text was retrieved from\n <http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>\n on Fri, 05 Feb 2016 20:30:28 +0200\n\nLicense: RRA-KEEP-THIS-NOTICE\n Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification, are\n permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright notice and\n this notice are preserved.  This file is offered as-is, without any\n warranty.\n\nLicense: Artistic-dist\n                       The \"Artistic License\"\n .\n                              Preamble\n .\n The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a\n Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some\n semblance of artistic control over the development of the Package,\n while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute\n the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make\n reasonable modifications.\n .\n It also grants you the rights to reuse parts of a Package in your own\n programs without transferring this License to those programs, provided\n that you meet some reasonable requirements.\n .\n Definitions:\n .\n         \"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the\n         Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files\n         created through textual modification.\n .\n         \"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been\n         modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes\n         of the Copyright Holder as specified below.\n .\n         \"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or\n         copyrights for the package.\n .\n         \"You\" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing\n         this Package.\n .\n         \"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the\n         basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,\n         and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the\n         Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large\n         as a market that must bear the fee.)\n .\n         \"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item\n         itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.\n         It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it\n         under the same conditions they received it.\n .\n 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the\n Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you\n duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n .\n 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications\n derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package\n modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n .\n 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided\n that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and\n when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the\n following:\n .\n     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them\n     Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or\n     an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive\n     site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include\n     your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\n .\n     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n .\n     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict\n     with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide\n     a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly\n     documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n .\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n .\n 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or\n executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n .\n     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,\n     together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where\n     to get the Standard Version.\n .\n     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of\n     the Package with your modifications.\n .\n     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly\n     document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together\n     with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n .\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n .\n 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this\n Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this\n Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,\n you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly\n commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software\n distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a\n product of your own.\n .\n 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as\n output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall\n under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated\n them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this\n Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this\n Package via the so-called \"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods of producing a\n binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall\n neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it\n fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do\n not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this\n Package.\n .\n 7. You may reuse parts of this Package in your own programs, provided that\n you explicitly state where you got them from, in the source code (and, left\n to your courtesy, in the documentation), duplicating all the associated\n copyright notices and disclaimers. Besides your changes, if any, must be\n clearly marked as such. Parts reused that way will no longer fall under this\n license if, and only if, the name of your program(s) have no immediate\n connection with the name of the Package itself or its associated programs.\n You may then apply whatever restrictions you wish on the reused parts or\n choose to place them in the Public Domain--this will apply only within the\n context of your package.\n .\n 8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote\n products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n .\n 9.

Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope\nCorporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software\nFoundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a\nnon-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related\nIntellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of\nthe PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope\nCorporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software\nFoundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a\nnon-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related\nIntellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of\nthe PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope\nCorporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software\nFoundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a\nnon-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related\nIntellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of\nthe PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Grants\n .\n Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\n non-exclusive license:\n .\n (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)\n     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,\n     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its\n     Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or\n     as part of a Larger Work; and\n .\n (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer\n     for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its\n     Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n .\n 2.2. Effective Date\n .\n The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\n become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\n distributes such Contribution.\n .\n 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n .\n The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\n this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\n distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\n Contributor:\n .\n (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n     or\n .\n (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n     Version); or\n .\n (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n     its Contributions.\n .\n This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\n the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n .\n 2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n .\n No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\n License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\n permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n .\n 2.5. Representation\n .\n Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\n to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n .\n 2.6. Fair Use\n .\n This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\n applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\n equivalents.\n .\n 2.7. Conditions\n .\n Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\n in Section 2.1.\n .\n 3. Responsibilities\n -------------------\n .\n 3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n .\n All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n Form.\n .\n 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n .\n If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n .\n (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n .\n (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n .\n 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n .\n You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n License(s).\n .\n 3.4. Notices\n .\n You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n .\n 3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n .\n You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n jurisdiction.\n .\n 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n ---------------------------------------------------\n .\n If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n .\n 5. Termination\n --------------\n .\n 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n Your receipt of the notice.\n .\n 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n .\n 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n prior to termination shall survive termination.\n .\n ************************************************************************\n *                                                                      *\n *  6.

Litigation\n -------------\n .\n Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\n courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\n place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\n jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\n Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\n cross-claims or counter-claims.\n .\n 9. Miscellaneous\n ----------------\n .\n This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\n matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\n that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\n shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n .\n 10. Versions of the License\n ---------------------------\n .\n 10.1. New Versions\n .\n Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n distinguishing version number.\n .\n 10.2. Effect of New Versions\n .\n You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\n of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\n or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n steward.\n .\n 10.3. Modified Versions\n .\n If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n such modified license differs from this License).\n .\n 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\n Licenses\n .\n If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\n Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\n notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n .\n Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n -------------------------------------------\n .\n   This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\n   License, v. 2.0.

Effective Date\n .\n The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\n become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\n distributes such Contribution.\n .\n 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n .\n The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\n this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\n distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\n Contributor:\n .\n (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n     or\n .\n (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n     Version); or\n .\n (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n     its Contributions.\n .\n This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\n the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n .\n 2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n .\n No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\n License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\n permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n .\n 2.5. Representation\n .\n Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\n to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n .\n 2.6. Fair Use\n .\n This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\n applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\n equivalents.\n .\n 2.7. Conditions\n .\n Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\n in Section 2.1.\n .\n 3. Responsibilities\n -------------------\n .\n 3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n .\n All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n Form.\n .\n 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n .\n If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n .\n (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n .\n (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n .\n 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n .\n You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n License(s).\n .\n 3.4. Notices\n .\n You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n .\n 3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n .\n You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n jurisdiction.\n .\n 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n ---------------------------------------------------\n .\n If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n .\n 5. Termination\n --------------\n .\n 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n Your receipt of the notice.\n .\n 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n .\n 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n prior to termination shall survive termination.\n .\n ************************************************************************\n *                                                                      *\n *  6.

Litigation\n -------------\n .\n Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\n courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\n place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\n jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\n Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\n cross-claims or counter-claims.\n .\n 9. Miscellaneous\n ----------------\n .\n This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\n matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\n that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\n shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n .\n 10. Versions of the License\n ---------------------------\n .\n 10.1. New Versions\n .\n Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n distinguishing version number.\n .\n 10.2. Effect of New Versions\n .\n You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\n of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\n or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n steward.\n .\n 10.3. Modified Versions\n .\n If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n such modified license differs from this License).\n .\n 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\n Licenses\n .\n If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\n Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\n notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n .\n Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n -------------------------------------------\n .\n   This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\n   License, v. 2.0.

If the\n terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to\n make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek\n a different licensing arrangement.\n .\n Definitions\n .\n     \"Copyright Holder\" means the individual(s) or organization(s)\n     named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\n .\n     \"Contributor\" means any party that has contributed code or other\n     material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's\n     procedures.\n .\n     \"You\" and \"your\" means any person who would like to copy,\n     distribute, or modify the Package.\n .\n     \"Package\" means the collection of files distributed by the\n     Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of\n     those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard\n     Version, or a Modified Version.\n .\n     \"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it\n     accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\n     organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n .\n     \"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing\n     this Package or providing support for this Package to another\n     party.  It does not mean licensing fees.\n .\n     \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been\n     modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested\n     by the Copyright Holder.\n .\n     \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and\n     such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright\n     Holder.\n .\n     \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with\n     the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as\n     it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n .\n     \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and\n     configuration files for the Package.\n .\n     \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,\n     or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or\n     translation of the Source form.\n .\n .\n Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n .\n (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\n Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\n you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\n .\n .\n Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n .\n (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\n Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\n either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\n all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At\n your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\n Compiled form of the Package.\n .\n (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\n modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting\n Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\n will be subject to the Original License.\n .\n .\n Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n .\n (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\n or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\n Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\n from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\n any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\n you do at least ONE of the following:\n .\n     (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\n     of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\n     Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\n     Version.\n .\n     (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\n     prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In\n     addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\n     from the name of the Standard Version.\n .\n     (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\n     make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\n     under\n .\n         (i)  the Original License or\n .\n         (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\n         modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\n         licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\n         received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\n         Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\n         available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\n         Fees are allowed.\n .\n .\n Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\n or Modified Versions without the Source\n .\n (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\n the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\n get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\n valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\n time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\n must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\n If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\n days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\n you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n .\n (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\n the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\n the Source of the Modified Version.\n .\n .\n Aggregating or Linking the Package\n .\n (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\n Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\n aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\n Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\n components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\n apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\n as included in the aggregation.\n .\n (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\n other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\n build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\n include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\n provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n .\n .\n Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n .\n (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\n merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\n the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\n considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\n terms of this license.\n .\n .\n General Provisions\n .\n (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\n Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\n modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\n use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\n license.\n .\n (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\n Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\n to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\n this license.\n .\n (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\n service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n .\n (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\n free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\n sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\n patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\n infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\n that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\n infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\n date that such litigation is filed.\n .\n (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\n THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\n IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES.

If the\n terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to\n make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek\n a different licensing arrangement.\n .\n Definitions\n .\n \"Copyright Holder\" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in\n the copyright notice for the entire Package.\n .\n \"Contributor\" means any party that has contributed code or other\n material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's\n procedures.\n .\n \"You\" and \"your\" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,\n or modify the Package.\n .\n \"Package\" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright\n Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A\n given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a\n Modified Version.\n .\n \"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it\n accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\n organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n .\n \"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this\n Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It\n does not mean licensing fees.\n .\n \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,\n or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the\n Copyright Holder.\n .\n \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such\n changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\n .\n \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the\n Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may\n be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n .\n \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and\n configuration files for the Package.\n .\n \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or\n any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation\n of the Source form.\n .\n Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n .\n (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\n Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\n you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\n .\n Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n .\n (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\n Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\n either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\n all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At\n your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\n Compiled form of the Package.\n .\n (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\n modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting\n Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\n will be subject to the Original License.\n .\n Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n .\n (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\n or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\n Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\n from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\n any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\n you do at least ONE of the following:\n .\n (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the\n Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright\n Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. (b)\n ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the\n user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the\n Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of\n the Standard Version. (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the\n Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version\n available to others under (i) the Original License or (ii) a license\n that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the\n Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy\n that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the\n Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\n available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are\n allowed.\n .\n Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified\n Versions without the Source\n .\n (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\n the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\n get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be\n valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any\n time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\n must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\n If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\n days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\n you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n .\n (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the\n Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the\n Source of the Modified Version.\n .\n Aggregating or Linking the Package\n .\n (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\n Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\n aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\n Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\n components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\n apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\n as included in the aggregation.\n .\n (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\n other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\n build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\n include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\n provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n .\n Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n .\n (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\n merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\n the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not\n considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\n terms of this license.\n .\n General Provisions\n .\n (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\n Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\n modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\n use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\n license.\n .\n (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version\n made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to\n ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\n this license.\n .\n (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\n service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n .\n (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\n free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\n sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\n patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\n infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\n that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\n infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\n date that such litigation is filed.\n .\n (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT\n HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED\n WARRANTIES.

Copyright and Related Rights include, but are\n not limited to, the following:\n .\n    the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\n    communicate, and translate a Work;\n .\n    moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n .\n    publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n    likeness depicted in a Work;\n .\n    rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n    subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n .\n    rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n .\n    database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC\n    of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996\n    on the legal protection of databases, and under any national\n    implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version\n    of such directive); and\n .\n    other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n    thereof.\n .\n 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\n of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\n irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all\n of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and\n causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing\n as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in\n all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by\n applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\n in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)\n for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,\n advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the\n Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\n detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such\n Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the\n quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's\n express Statement of Purpose.\n .\n 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any\n reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,\n then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted\n taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In\n addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby\n grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non\n sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license\n to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i)\n in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided\n by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\n in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)\n for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,\n advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall\n be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity\n or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,\n and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)\n exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in\n the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action\n with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express\n Statement of Purpose.\n .\n 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n .\n    No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,\n    abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this\n    document.\n .\n    Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\n    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties\n    of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non\n    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,\n    or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,\n    all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n .\n    Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other\n    persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including\n    without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the\n    Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any\n    necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any\n    use of the Work.\n .\n    Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not\n    a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect\n    to this CC0 or use of the Work.\nComment:\n This license text was retrieved from\n <http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>\n on Fri, 05 Feb 2016 20:30:28 +0200\n\nLicense: RRA-KEEP-THIS-NOTICE\n Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification, are\n permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright notice and\n this notice are preserved.

(You will not be required to justify it to the\n         Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large\n         as a market that must bear the fee.)\n .\n         \"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item\n         itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.\n         It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it\n         under the same conditions they received it.\n .\n 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the\n Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you\n duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n .\n 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications\n derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package\n modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n .\n 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided\n that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and\n when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the\n following:\n .\n     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them\n     Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or\n     an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive\n     site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include\n     your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\n .\n     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n .\n     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict\n     with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide\n     a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly\n     documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n .\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n .\n 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or\n executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n .\n     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,\n     together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where\n     to get the Standard Version.\n .\n     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of\n     the Package with your modifications.\n .\n     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly\n     document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together\n     with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n .\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n .\n 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this\n Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this\n Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,\n you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly\n commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software\n distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a\n product of your own.\n .\n 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as\n output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall\n under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated\n them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this\n Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this\n Package via the so-called \"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods of producing a\n binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall\n neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it\n fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do\n not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this\n Package.\n .\n 7. You may reuse parts of this Package in your own programs, provided that\n you explicitly state where you got them from, in the source code (and, left\n to your courtesy, in the documentation), duplicating all the associated\n copyright notices and disclaimers. Besides your changes, if any, must be\n clearly marked as such. Parts reused that way will no longer fall under this\n license if, and only if, the name of your program(s) have no immediate\n connection with the name of the Package itself or its associated programs.\n You may then apply whatever restrictions you wish on the reused parts or\n choose to place them in the Public Domain--this will apply only within the\n context of your package.\n .\n 8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote\n products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n .\n 9.

If the\n terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to\n make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek\n a different licensing arrangement.\n .\n Definitions\n .\n \"Copyright Holder\" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in\n the copyright notice for the entire Package.\n .\n \"Contributor\" means any party that has contributed code or other\n material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's\n procedures.\n .\n \"You\" and \"your\" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,\n or modify the Package.\n .\n \"Package\" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright\n Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A\n given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a\n Modified Version.\n .\n \"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it\n accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\n organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n .\n \"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this\n Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It\n does not mean licensing fees.\n .\n \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,\n or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the\n Copyright Holder.\n .\n \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such\n changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\n .\n \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the\n Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may\n be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n .\n \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and\n configuration files for the Package.\n .\n \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or\n any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation\n of the Source form.\n .\n Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n .\n (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\n Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\n you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\n .\n Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n .\n (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\n Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\n either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\n all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At\n your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\n Compiled form of the Package.\n .\n (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\n modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting\n Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\n will be subject to the Original License.\n .\n Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n .\n (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\n or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\n Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\n from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\n any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\n you do at least ONE of the following:\n .\n (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the\n Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright\n Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. (b)\n ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the\n user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the\n Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of\n the Standard Version. (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the\n Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version\n available to others under (i) the Original License or (ii) a license\n that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the\n Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy\n that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the\n Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\n available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are\n allowed.\n .\n Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified\n Versions without the Source\n .\n (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\n the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\n get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be\n valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any\n time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\n must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\n If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\n days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\n you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n .\n (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the\n Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the\n Source of the Modified Version.\n .\n Aggregating or Linking the Package\n .\n (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\n Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\n aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\n Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\n components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\n apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\n as included in the aggregation.\n .\n (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\n other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\n build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\n include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\n provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n .\n Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n .\n (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\n merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\n the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not\n considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\n terms of this license.\n .\n General Provisions\n .\n (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\n Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\n modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\n use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\n license.\n .\n (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version\n made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to\n ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\n this license.\n .\n (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\n service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n .\n (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\n free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\n sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\n patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\n infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\n that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\n infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\n date that such litigation is filed.\n .\n (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT\n HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED\n WARRANTIES.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal\n of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and\n scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for\n their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\n .\n For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\n expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person\n associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that\n he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,\n voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute\n the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and\n Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect\n of CC0 on those rights.\n .\n 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright\n and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are\n not limited to, the following:\n .\n    the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\n    communicate, and translate a Work;\n .\n    moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n .\n    publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n    likeness depicted in a Work;\n .\n    rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n    subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n .\n    rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n .\n    database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC\n    of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996\n    on the legal protection of databases, and under any national\n    implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version\n    of such directive); and\n .\n    other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n    thereof.\n .\n 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\n of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\n irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all\n of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and\n causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing\n as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in\n all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by\n applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\n in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)\n for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,\n advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the\n Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\n detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such\n Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the\n quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's\n express Statement of Purpose.\n .\n 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any\n reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,\n then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted\n taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In\n addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby\n grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non\n sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license\n to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i)\n in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided\n by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\n in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)\n for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,\n advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall\n be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity\n or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,\n and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)\n exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in\n the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action\n with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express\n Statement of Purpose.\n .\n 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n .\n    No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,\n    abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this\n    document.\n .\n    Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\n    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties\n    of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non\n    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,\n    or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,\n    all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n .\n    Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other\n    persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including\n    without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the\n    Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any\n    necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any\n    use of the Work.\n .\n    Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not\n    a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect\n    to this CC0 or use of the Work.\nComment:\n This license text was retrieved from\n <http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>\n on Fri, 05 Feb 2016 20:30:28 +0200\n\nLicense: RRA-KEEP-THIS-NOTICE\n Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification, are\n permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright notice and\n this notice are preserved.  This file is offered as-is, without any\n warranty.\n\nLicense: Artistic-dist\n                       The \"Artistic License\"\n .\n                              Preamble\n .\n The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a\n Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some\n semblance of artistic control over the development of the Package,\n while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute\n the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make\n reasonable modifications.\n .\n It also grants you the rights to reuse parts of a Package in your own\n programs without transferring this License to those programs, provided\n that you meet some reasonable requirements.\n .\n Definitions:\n .\n         \"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the\n         Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files\n         created through textual modification.\n .\n         \"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been\n         modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes\n         of the Copyright Holder as specified below.\n .\n         \"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or\n         copyrights for the package.\n .\n         \"You\" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing\n         this Package.\n .\n         \"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the\n         basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,\n         and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the\n         Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large\n         as a market that must bear the fee.)\n .\n         \"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item\n         itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.\n         It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it\n         under the same conditions they received it.\n .\n 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the\n Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you\n duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n .\n 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications\n derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package\n modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n .\n 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided\n that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and\n when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the\n following:\n .\n     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them\n     Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or\n     an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive\n     site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include\n     your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\n .\n     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n .\n     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict\n     with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide\n     a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly\n     documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n .\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n .\n 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or\n executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n .\n     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,\n     together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where\n     to get the Standard Version.\n .\n     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of\n     the Package with your modifications.\n .\n     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly\n     document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together\n     with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n .\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n .\n 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this\n Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this\n Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,\n you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly\n commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software\n distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a\n product of your own.\n .\n 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as\n output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall\n under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated\n them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this\n Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this\n Package via the so-called \"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods of producing a\n binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall\n neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it\n fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do\n not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this\n Package.\n .\n 7. You may reuse parts of this Package in your own programs, provided that\n you explicitly state where you got them from, in the source code (and, left\n to your courtesy, in the documentation), duplicating all the associated\n copyright notices and disclaimers. Besides your changes, if any, must be\n clearly marked as such. Parts reused that way will no longer fall under this\n license if, and only if, the name of your program(s) have no immediate\n connection with the name of the Package itself or its associated programs.\n You may then apply whatever restrictions you wish on the reused parts or\n choose to place them in the Public Domain--this will apply only within the\n context of your package.\n .\n 8.

Python was written by Guido van Rossum <guido@cwi.nl> and others.\n\nThis package was put together by Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org> from\nsources from ftp.python.org:/pub/python, based on the Debianization by\nthe previous maintainers Bernd S.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope\nCorporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software\nFoundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a\nnon-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related\nIntellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of\nthe PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope\nCorporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software\nFoundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a\nnon-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related\nIntellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of\nthe PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope\nCorporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software\nFoundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a\nnon-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related\nIntellectual Property.

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

Major\n portions are based on code by other authors; see AUTHORS for details.\n Most of the source has been put into the public domain, but some files\n have not (details below).\n .\n This file describes the source package.  The binary packages contain\n some files derived from other works: for example, images in the API\n documentation come from Doxygen.\nLicense:\n Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here\n is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this\n package (but check the individual files to be sure!):\n .\n   - liblzma is in the public domain.\n .\n   - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public\n     domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked\n     in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under\n     GNU LGPLv2.1+.\n .\n   - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been\n     adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are\n     under GNU GPLv2+.\n .\n   - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the\n     XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories\n     are in the public domain.\n .\n   - Translated messages are in the public domain.\n .\n   - The build system contains public domain files, and files that\n     are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up\n     in the binaries being built.\n .\n   - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging\n     utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.\n .\n   - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files\n     that are under various free software licenses.\n .\n You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into\n the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,\n take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find\n the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many\n lawyers.\n .\n As usual, this software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty.\n .\n If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils\n into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is\n polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but\n naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good\n notice to put into \"about box\" or into documentation:\n .\n     This software includes code from XZ Utils <http://tukaani.org/xz/>.\n .\n The following license texts are included in the following files:\n   - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1\n   - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2\n   - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3\n .\n Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code\n pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma\n binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety\n even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source\n package.\n .\n If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more\n information.\n\nFiles: *\nCopyright: 2006-2018, Lasse Collin\n           1999-2008, Igor Pavlov\n           2006, Ville Koskinen\n           1998, Steve Reid\n           2000, Wei Dai\n           2003, Kevin Springle\n           2009, Jonathan Nieder\n           2010, Anders F Bj\u00f6rklund\nLicense: PD\n This file has been put in the public domain.\n You can do whatever you want with this file.\nComment:\n  From: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>\n  To: Jonathan Nieder <jrnieder@gmail.com>\n  Subject: Re: XZ utils for Debian\n  Date: Sun, 19 Jul 2009 13:28:23 +0300\n  Message-Id: <200907191328.23816.lasse.collin@tukaani.org>\n .\n [...]\n .\n  > AUTHORS, ChangeLog, COPYING, README, THANKS, TODO,\n  > dos/README, windows/README\n .\n  COPYING says that most docs are in the public domain. Maybe that's not\n  clear enough, but on the other hand it looks a bit stupid to put\n  copyright information in tiny and relatively small docs like README.\n .\n  I don't dare to say that _all_ XZ Utils specific docs are in the public\n  domain unless otherwise mentioned in the file. I'm including PDF files\n  generated by groff + ps2pdf, and some day I might include Doxygen-\n  generated HTML docs too. Those don't include any copyright notices, but\n  it seems likely that groff + ps2pdf or at least Doxygen put some\n  copyrighted content into the generated files.\n\nFiles: INSTALL NEWS PACKAGERS\n windows/README-Windows.txt\n windows/INSTALL-MinGW.txt\nCopyright: 2009-2010, Lasse Collin\nLicense: probably-PD\n See the note on AUTHORS, README, and so on above.\n\nFiles: src/scripts/* lib/* extra/scanlzma/scanlzma.c\nCopyright: \u00a9 1993, Jean-loup Gailly\n           \u00a9 1989-1994, 1996-1999, 2001-2007, Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n           \u00a9 2006 Timo Lindfors\n           2005, Charles Levert\n           2005, 2009, Lasse Collin\n           2009, Andrew Dudman\nOther-Authors: Paul Eggert, Ulrich Drepper\nLicense: GPL-2+\n\nFiles: src/scripts/Makefile.am src/scripts/xzless.1\nCopyright: 2009, Andrew Dudman\n           2009, Lasse Collin\nLicense: PD\n This file has been put in the public domain.\n You can do whatever you want with this file.\n\nFiles: doc/examples/xz_pipe_comp.c doc/examples/xz_pipe_decomp.c\nCopyright: 2010, Daniel Mealha Cabrita\nLicense: PD\n Not copyrighted -- provided to the public domain.\n\nFiles: lib/getopt.c lib/getopt1.c lib/getopt.in.h\nCopyright: \u00a9 1987-2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nOther-Authors: Ulrich Drepper\nLicense: LGPL-2.1+\n\nFiles: m4/getopt.m4 m4/posix-shell.m4\nCopyright: \u00a9 2002-2006, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n           \u00a9 2007-2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nOther-Authors: Bruno Haible, Paul Eggert\nLicense: permissive-fsf\n\nFiles: m4/acx_pthread.m4\nCopyright: \u00a9 2008, Steven G.
